# Image-Blending-using-Gaussian-and-Laplacian-Pyramids

* I have chosen 3 pairs of images namely A_x and B_x (x= number) and blended them together. 
* The blended images are named as LS_x.png and the masks as Mask_x.png.
* A GUI is also included in a separate cell in the notebook for creating a rectangular mask.
